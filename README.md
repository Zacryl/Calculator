# Calculator
Just a simple console driven calculator. 
I wanted to code something for fun and decided a calculator was probably a very common task.
Methods and variables are static instead of instatances since I developed it around the idea of it being *The Only* calculator and not a series of calculators
that needs to be instantiated for different reason. And also it was a short time project.
Goal with this project is to later develop it into a GUI driven calculator.

I made this calculator with no research and purely based of my own thoughts.

For now it has a few features like
Adding two numbers together.
Dividing two numbers.
Multiply two numbers.
Subtract two numbers.

It also includes a way to close the application as well as a way to clear your last number and an automatic last results history.
